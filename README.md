## Assignment 1

## Miniproject

The miniproject is added as a git submodule. The original github repo is present at [Github Repo Link](https://github.com/Souritra-Garai/elbow-manipulator.git).
To initialize the submodule, enter the following commands after cloning the present repo and switching to the present branch
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Task 1a of the Miniproject is not feasible. We cannot design an open-loop torque based robot controller without accounting the dynamics of the robot.
Providing only the torque to maintain the system at equilibrium at the desired configuration fails to accelerate / move the robot or even counter the robot's weight in the present configuration.
This is because the torque required to maintain equilibrium in configurations where (q1, q2) are close to pi/2 is smaller compared to that where (q1, q2) is close to zero or pi.
