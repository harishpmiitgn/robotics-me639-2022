# robotics-me639-2022
My submission for the ITR Mini project includes working codes of Task 1 and Task 4. 
I coded the algorithm for Task 2 but was not able to resolve the errors, thus the simulation for the same does not run.

I faced many difficulties while getting adapted to python and the associated libraries. Thus, while coding the solution for the dynamics part of Task 1 and Task 3, I was able to understand the logic implemented but couldnâ€™t showcase the same through my codes. I will make sure that I keep trying to finish this project as and when I get the time.

Libraries used: matplotlib, render, numpy
